# Cow-milk-yield-prediction-
prediction of Cow's Milk using machine learning (PyCaret : Anatomy of Regression)

Some of the features that the dataset contain are as :
 ~ AFC (age at first Calving)
 ~ FSP (first service period)
 ~ FDP (first dry period)
 ~ FCI (first calving interval)
 ~ DTAP (days to attain peak yield)
 ~ FLMY (first lactation milk yield)
 ~ Peak yield
 ~ 30 days milk yield
 ~ 60 days milk yield
 ~ 90 days milk yield
 
Our target variable is "days_305"
i.e milk yield in 305 days.


Steps during model selecton are:
 ~ Data loading
 ~ Data cleaning
 ~ Data Visualization
 ~ Setting up environment
 ~ creating a model
 ~ Predicting our target variable
 ~ checking for best results( less error and high r_square values)
